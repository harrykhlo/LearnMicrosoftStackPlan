# Harry's Learning Plan for Microsoft Technology Stack

This is Harry’s learning plan for Microsoft Technology Stack. After several internship experiences in various technology stacks, he was overwhelmed by so many different technology stacks and the enormous amount of their technical details. Fortunately, he has been being enlightened, inspired and guided by his mentor, Martin Herran, from the Canterbury Tech. Harry therefore focuses to strive for Microsoft Technology Stack, and has been updating and implementing this learning plan which is maintained https://github.com/harrykhlo/LearnMicrosoftStackPlan. Further details are given in the word document file "Learning Plan - Microsoft Technology Stack.docx"

At the same time, he puts his learning into practices through building the public and private applications below.
